Research Interests
=================
* **Nanogenerators, nanosensors and nanodevices.** We use Physical-Chemical methods to prepare nano-materials with unique properties for energy harvesting, self-powered sensor and energy storage. 
* **Scattering spectrum study of materials with strong electron correlations.** We use spectroscopic methods to study the structure and coupling dynamics in transition-metal compounds.
* **Data mining.** We use AI algorithms to analysis the recorded data from sensor network.
