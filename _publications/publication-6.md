### Abstract

In this investigation, the chain conformation transformation of the piezoelectric polymer of a poly(L-Lactic Acid) (PLLA) film was analyzed under an electric field for the first time using infrared spectroscopy. It is revealed that the piezoelectric shear mode coefficient d<sub>14</sub> (∼10 pC/N) of a stretched <i>α</i> form PLLA film mainly comes from the rotation of C=O dipoles inside the polymer main chain. The reorientation of the dipoles causes the deformation of the crystal structure, which corresponds to a shear mode strain macroscopically in the PLLA film along a 45° direction to the polymer length. The back-bone of the molecular chain keeps its own conformation of a 10<sub>3</sub> helix under an external field up to 100 MV/m
