### Abstract

Fine ferroelectric properties with remnant polarization of 22.7 μC/cm<sup>2</sup> and coercive field of 16.1 kV/cm of (1-x)K<sub>0.5</sub>Na<sub>0.5</sub>NbO<sub>3</sub>-xLiNbO<sub>3</sub> ((1-x)KNN-xLN) ceramics were obtained by laser sintering method. The optimum piezoelectric properties of piezoelectric constant d<sub>33</sub> ∼ 110 pC/N do not exist in the ceramics with the amount of LiNbO<sub>3</sub> at x = 0.06 but lower to x = 0.04. The texture structure with the increase of (00l) orientation along the spontaneous polarization directions results in strong contribution to the ferroelectric response. High substitution effect of Li<sup>+</sup> leads to the transformation from orthorhombic phase to tetragonal phases occurring at lower amount of LiNbO<sub>3</sub>.
