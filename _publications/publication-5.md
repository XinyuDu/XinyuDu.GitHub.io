### Abstract

We report on observation of ferroelastic domain structure in single crystals of multiferroic CaMn<sub>7</sub>O<sub>12</sub> at room temperature. Two types of ferroelastic domain wall are found, consistent with the materialâ€™s rhombohedral symmetry that is reduced from cubic symmetry at higher temperatures. Using Raman spectroscopy along with othermeasurements,we develop a systematic method to determine the microscopic domain orientation. Moreover, we find a switching behavior of the domains, which allows us to detwin the crystals conveniently at room temperature using a moderate uniaxial compression. Our result paves theway for further spectroscopic study and domain engineering in CaMn<sub>7</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.
