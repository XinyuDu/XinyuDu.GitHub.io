### Abstract

In recent years, people pay more attention to the protection against chemical warfare agents, due to the increase in the probability of usage of these chemical warfare agents in wars or terrorist attacks. In this workï¼ŒMgO nanoparticles were in-situ growth on the surface of poly(m-phenylene Isophthalamide) (PMIA) forming a flexible and breathable fabric for the detoxification of mustard gas surrogate. The as-prepared nanofibrous membrane possesses a "flower-like" structure of which endows not only increase the specific surface area of the composite but also 
prevent the agglomeration of the MgO nanoparticles. The detoxification ability of the PMIA@MgO nanofibrous fabric was demonstrated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). It is found that after 20 h of reaction time, 70.56% of the mustard gas surrogate have been decomposed.
