### Abstract

we have demonstrated a skin-like pressure sensor with high sensitivity, good 
flexibility, fast response speed, outstanding air permeability, and light  weight  through 
electrospinning and screen-printing, which are suitable for low-cost and large-area production. 
Due to many air gaps of thermoplastic polyurethane nanofiber membranes, the skin-like pressure sensor exhibited high sensitivity of 4.2 kPa<sup>-1</sup>. Based on good air circulation in the dielectric layer, the pressure sensor has shown fast response time of less than 26 ms. Besides, the skin-like poly(vinylidene fluoride) nanofiber membranes substrate has endowed the pressure sensor with air  permeability  and hydrophobicity. The skin-like sensor was applied in monitoring human physiological signals such as  respiration and  heart rate. In addition, a large-area pressure sensor array has been fabricated by screen-printing and realized the detection of the external pressure distribution. As a result, the breathable and screen-print capacitive pressure sensor could provide a promising strategy  for the design of e-skins with air permeability.
