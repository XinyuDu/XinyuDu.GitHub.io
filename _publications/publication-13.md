### Abstract

Scientific and commercial advances have set high requirements for wearable electronics. However, the power supply, breathability, and mass production of wearable electronics still have many challenges that need to be overcome. In this study, a self-powered nanofiber-based triboelectric sensor (SNTS) was fabricated by batch-scale fabrication technologies using electrospinning and screen-printing for health monitoring via respiratory monitoring. Typically, an arch structural SNTS is assembled by a nanofiber membrane and a Ag nanoparticle electrode. The pile of nanofibers and the conductive network of Ag nanoparticles ensure agas channel across the whole device. The gas permeability of the SNTS was as high as 6.16 mm/s, which has overwhelming advantages when compared with commonly used wearable devices composed of air-tight cast films. Due to the softness of the nanofiber membrane, the SNTS showed excellent electronic output performance irrespective of whether it was bent, twisted, or folded. The superior properties, such as breathability, skin-friendliness, self-power, and batch fabrication of SNTS offer huge potential for their application in healthcare monitoring and multifunctional intelligent systems.
