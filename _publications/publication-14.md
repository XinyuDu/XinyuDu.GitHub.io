### Abstract

Private and security information for personal identification requires an
encrypted tool to extend communication channels between human and machine
through a convenient and secure method. Here we report a triboelectric-based
transparent secret code (TSC) that enables self-powered sensing and information
identification simultaneously in a rapid process method. The transparent and
hydrophobic TSC can be conformed to any cambered surface due to its high
flexibility which extends the application scenarios greatly. Independent of the
power source, the TSC can induce obvious electric signals only
by surface contact. This TSC is velocity-dependent and capable of achieving a peak voltage of ~4 V at a resistance load of 10 MW and a sliding speed of 0.1 m/s, according to a 2 mm Ã— 20 mm rectangular stripe. The fabricated TSC can maintain its performance after reciprocating rolling for about 5000 times. We demonstrate the applications of TSC as a self-powered code device, and the ordered signals can be recognized through the
height of the electric peaks, which can be further transferred into specific information by the processing program. The designed TSC has great potential in personal identification, commodity circulation, valuables management and security defense applications.
