### Abstract

The flexible and stretchable electronics have been considered as next-generation electronics. Stretchable triboelectric nanogenerators (S-TENGs) with both multifunction and comfort have become a hot field of research for wearable electronic devices recently. Here, we designed an all-nanofiber-based, ultralight, S-TENG that could be softly attached on skins for motion energy harvesting and self-powered biomechanical monitoring. The S-TENG consisted of only two nanofiber membranes: a polyvinylidene fluoride nanofiber membrane (PVDFNM) supported by thermoplastic polyurethane nanofiber membrane (TPUNM) was used as the frictional layer, and a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) conductive material screen-printed on the TPUNM was used as the electrode layer. Due to the excellent stretchability of TPUNM, the S-TENG could generate electricity under various types of deformation, and regains its original performance after intense mechanical extension, even if it is partially cut or damaged. Owing to the great electronegativity of PVDFNM, the device generated a maximum voltage of 225 V and a current of 4.5 μA with an electrode area of 6 × 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The S-TENG has great potential applications in self-powered wearable devices, electronic skins, and smart sensor networks.
