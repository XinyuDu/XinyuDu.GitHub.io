### Abstract

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for harvesting rotary mechanical energy 
are mostly based on in-plane sliding or free-standing mode. However, the 
relative displacement between two contacting triboelectric layers will cause 
abrasion, which lowers the output power and reduce the service life. It is 
important to develop a method  to minimize abrasion when harvesting rotary 
mechanical energy. Here we report a scale-like structured TENG (SL-TENG), in 
which the two triboelectric layers work in contact-separation mode to avoid the in-plane relative sliding in order to minimize abrasion. As a result, the SL-TENG shows outstanding robustness. The output voltage does not exhiit 
measurable decay after continuously generating more than 1 million cycles. The SL-TENG can generate a maximum short-circuit current of 78  Î¼A, delivering instantaneous power density of 2.54 W/m<sup>2</sup> to external load at a very low rotation rate of 120 rpm. A discharge capacity of 0.1 mAh is achieved after a 30 min charging of an Li-ion battery by SL-TENG. A continuous d.c. output of 5 V is achieved by using a power management circuit, which provides enough d.c. power for driving a radio-frequency (RF) wireless sensor and other conventional electronics.
