### Abstract

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) have been proven to be effective for the collection of low-frequency vibrational energy in the environment. However, most polymer materials as friction layers are highly susceptible to mechanical damage during operation, which reduces the performance and lifetime of TENG. Herein, we report a high-performance, flexible triboelectric nanogenerator with reproducible self-healing electronic characteristics. Based on its soft and flexible polymers, the self-healing triboelectric nanogenerator (SH-TENG) can achieve a peak power of 2.5 W m<sup>−2</sup> and triboelectric charge density of about 100 μC m<sup>−2</sup>. High-conductance Ag nanowires (AgNWs) are semi-embedded in the polymer to fabricate all-in-one friction layers and for an enhanced self-healing process. Both the output voltage and current of the healed device can reach up to about 99% of their original values even after five cutting/healing cycles. The fabricated SH-TENG has excellent stability and flexibility, which presents a significant step towards the fabrication of reliable triboelectric nanogenerators with recoverability and low maintenance costs.
