### Abstract

We report inelastic light scattering measurements of lattice dynamics related to the incommensurate orbital order in CaMn<sub>7</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. Below the ordering temperature T<sub>o</sub> ≈ 250 K, we observe extra phonon peaks as a result of Brillouin zone folding, as well as a soft vibrational mode with a power-law T-dependent energy, Ω = Ω<sub>0</sub>(1−T/T<sub>o</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>. This temperature dependence demonstrates the second-order nature of the transition at T<sub>o</sub>, and it indicates that the soft mode can be regarded as the amplitude excitation of the composite order parameter. Our result strongly suggests that the lattice degrees of freedom are actively involved in the orbital-ordering mechanism.
