### Abstract

Taking laser as the heat source for ceramic sintering, 0.94(K<sub>0.5</sub>Na<sub>0.5</sub>)NbO<sub>3</sub>-0.06LiTaO<sub>3</sub> ceramics with unique physical properties were prepared. Fine ferroelectric properties with remnant polarization of 18 μC/cm<sup>2</sup> and coercive field of 18.8 kV/cm were obtained. The piezoelectric properties and density of the ceramics were d<sub>33</sub>∼120 pC/N, k<sub>p</sub>∼36.6%, T<sub>C</sub>∼420 °C, and ρ∼4.125 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The shift of the two phase transition temperatures (tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition temperature TO-TTO-T shifting to 100 °C from 190 °C while Curie temperature T<sub>c</sub> shifting to 420 from 394 °C in laser-sintered ceramics reflects large structure distortion of phase transition and Li<sup>+</sup> substitution of high temperature phase. Orientation degree of the texture structure based on anisometric grains of submicron diameter in the ceramics was 23%. The texture structure corresponding to the fine ferroelectric properties was resulted from the mass transform in liquid phase and strictly heating directivity of laser irradiation. O<sub>2</sub> discharge through coaxial nozzle takes some actions like O<sub>2</sub> annealing and effectively suppression on the volatilization of Na<sub>2</sub>O during laser sintering. Lager substitution of Li<sup>+</sup> leads to the presence of small amount of K<sub>3</sub>Li<sub>2</sub>Nb<sub>5</sub>O<sub>15</sub> phase damaging in d<sub>33</sub>. By analysis of the sintering effects on the properties and structure evolution, laser sintering was shown as a promising method in preparation of functional ceramics with excellent and applicable physical properties, compared to a traditional furnace sintering method.
