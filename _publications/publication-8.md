### Abstract

We present a systematic study of spin and lattice dynamics in the quasi-one-dimensional spiral magnet CuBr<sub>2</sub>, using Raman scattering in conjunction with infrared and neutron spectroscopy as well as first-principles calculation. A rich set of broad Raman peaks are observed as spin correlations develop upon cooling. The energies of these peaks approximately correspond to those of sharp optical phonons seen from our Raman and infrared data, and inelastic neutron scattering further reveals that most, if not all, of them are precisely equal to phonon-dispersion energies at the one- but not the three-dimensional magnetic wave vector. The low-energy peaks further exhibit a distinct intensity maximum at the magnetic ordering temperature. Our observations point towards the emergence of dynamic spin-orbital-lattice textures, or “magnetophonons”, at dispersion intersecting points of phonons and spin excitations.
